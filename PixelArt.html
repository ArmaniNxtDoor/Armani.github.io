	<p> I started my pixel character by using a black outline to draw a head and just started poking around with it from there. My inspiration was a samurai so I then decided to dress him in a yukata with a sword next to him. My character looks like he is un-bothered and looks very non-intelligent. I didn't mean to do that on purpose but oh well. My character would be in a game for a samurai RPO probably just running around looking for revenge or something, the typical samurai would.
