	<p> To start off this project we searched for images of celebrities we would like to photoshop. Me being the boss man I am, chose to represent another boss man by the name of Cristian bale, a picture of him when he was acting as patrick bateman in the film American Psycho to be more precise. We first made swatches with the color of our celebrities to later on try to duplicate the image with those same swatches. Then we duplicated the image 4 times putting one in each corner of the screen. Overall a pretty fun project as I did enjoy having to recreate an image of myself. (Iâ€™m patrick Bateman)
