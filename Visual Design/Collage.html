	<p> I chose asian hate and the reason for that is because I donâ€™t think it is talked about enough. When it peaked it was all the world could talk about but after that peak the fight for the cause vanished while the violence didn't. People are still losing their lives and nobody is worrying about these violations. To fight for this movement I decided to provide a main message in the middle of the screen surrounded by other photos representing the stop asian hate movement.
