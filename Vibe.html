	<p> I started my project by gathering images that resided near halloween since my 6 word memoir can be represented by it. After gathering images I started using adobe express which was a pretty easy experience as it has a clear format and is also similar to canvas another site I used in the past. I tried to follow this brown/orange colorwave throughout my collage with the exception of a few pictures. I included pictures that I personally liked, for example the office photo where micheal has a pumpkin on his head or that one photo of drake sitting there. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because I really love halloween and tan/brown have been one of my favorite color combinations for a while as well.
